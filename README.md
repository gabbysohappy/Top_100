Basic Objectives:

Create a new rails app and make sure you make it a git repo and have a github repo linked to it
Billboard Model   has_many artists ex.  top 100 us, top 100 euro, top 50, ect...
Artist Model - belongs_to billboard  and has_many songs
Song Model - belongs_to artist (Links to an external site.)
Have Validations for each model
All CRUD actions for each Table
Fill out all the controllers
Fill out the views
This is going to use nested routes for easier use of controller data flow

Bonus Objectives:

Add A navbar and footer
Add Static pages
refactor the Song Model - belongs_to artist, belongs_to billboard (HINT: since Rails 5 you'll need to use optional: true on your association because a song is not always going to belong to a billboard) - http://blog.bigbinary.com/2016/02/15/rails-5-makes-belong-to-association-required-by-default.html
Add any other models that you see fit to make it a more robust application
Have the ability to play/preview the songs (there are many gems out there that let you interact with iTunes or Spotify or Soundcloud)
DRY up any code and do a full refactor of anything to make the code the cleanest you can
Ability to move song up or down a Billboard
Style it to make it look professional, use Bootstrap, Materialize, Foundation, Semantic UI, Etc...
